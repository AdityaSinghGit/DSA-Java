Here's a table with some trick questions involving bitwise operations along with their solutions:

========Question & Solutions=========
⚪Check if a number is even.	
(num & 1) == 0

⚪Check if a number is odd.	
(num & 1) == 1 or !(num & 1)

⚪Check if a number is a power of two.	
(num != 0) && ((num & (num - 1)) == 0)

⚪Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.	
a = a ^ b; b = a ^ b; a = a ^ b;

⚪Toggle the nth bit of a number.	
num = num ^ (1 << n)

⚪Check if the nth bit is set in a number.	
(num & (1 << n)) != 0

⚪Set the nth bit of a number.	
`num = num

⚪Clear the nth bit of a number.	
num = num & ~(1 << n)

⚪Count the number of set bits (popcount) in a number.	
GeeksforGeeks: Count set bits or Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

⚪Find the only non-repeating element in an array where every other element repeats twice.	
XOR all elements, the result will be the non-repeating element.

⚪Check if the sign of two integers is different.	
(a ^ b) < 0

⚪Check if all bits are set.	
num == -1 (Assuming 2's complement representation where -1 has all bits set)

⚪Check if all bits are unset.	
num == 0

⚪Reverse bits of a number.	
GeeksforGeeks: Reverse bits

⚪Find the maximum xor of two numbers in an array.	
GeeksforGeeks: Maximum XOR

⚪Find the missing number in an array where every other number appears twice.	
XOR all elements in the array with indices and then with array values, the result will be the missing number.

⚪Count the number of bits to flip to convert A to B.	
GeeksforGeeks: Number of bits to flip

⚪Find the majority element in an array.	
GeeksforGeeks: Majority element

⚪Generate power set using bitwise operators.	
GeeksforGeeks: Power set

⚪Find the element that appears once in an array where every other element appears thrice.	
GeeksforGeeks: Element appears once
