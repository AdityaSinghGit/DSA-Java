Here's a table with some trick questions involving bitwise operations along with their solutions:

========Question & Solutions=========

丘뾖heck if a number is even.	
    游릭(num & 1) == 0

丘뾖heck if a number is odd.	
    游릭(num & 1) == 1 or !(num & 1)

丘뾖heck if a number is a power of two.	
    游릭(num != 0) && ((num & (num - 1)) == 0)

丘뾥wap two numbers without using a temporary variable.	
    游릭a = a ^ b; b = a ^ b; a = a ^ b;

丘뾦oggle the nth bit of a number.	
    游릭num = num ^ (1 << n)

丘뾖heck if the nth bit is set in a number.	
    游릭(num & (1 << n)) != 0

丘뾥et the nth bit of a number.	
    游릭`num = num

丘뾖lear the nth bit of a number.	
    游릭num = num & ~(1 << n)

丘뾖ount the number of set bits (popcount) in a number.	
    游릭GeeksforGeeks: Count set bits or Brian Kernighan's Algorithm

丘뾙ind the only non-repeating element in an array where every other element repeats twice.	
    游릭XOR all elements, the result will be the non-repeating element.

丘뾖heck if the sign of two integers is different.	
    游릭(a ^ b) < 0

丘뾖heck if all bits are set.	
    游릭num == -1 (Assuming 2's complement representation where -1 has all bits set)

丘뾖heck if all bits are unset.	
    游릭num == 0

丘Reverse bits of a number.	
    游릭GeeksforGeeks: Reverse bits

丘뾙ind the maximum xor of two numbers in an array.	
    游릭GeeksforGeeks: Maximum XOR

丘뾙ind the missing number in an array where every other number appears twice.	
    游릭XOR all elements in the array with indices and then with array values, the result will be the missing number.

丘뾖ount the number of bits to flip to convert A to B.	
    游릭GeeksforGeeks: Number of bits to flip

丘뾙ind the majority element in an array.	
    游릭GeeksforGeeks: Majority element
