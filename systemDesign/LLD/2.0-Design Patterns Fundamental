The fundamental of every design pattern is to separate out what changes over period of time from what remains constant. 
As you see in Strategy pattern, we are trying to separate out dependency of drive from the main class  as much as possible by making various strategies 
to inject it dynamically based on client requirement so that in future if new requirement for drive comes, 
there will be minimal/no changes in existing code(Open closed Principle).
